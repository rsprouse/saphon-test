<h5> About </h5>
The SAPhon database currently includes inventories for <?=$n_lang?> languages and varieties.
</p>
The principal purpose of the SAPhon site is to share data regarding the phonological inventories of South American indigenous languages for purposes of linguistic research and education. Phonological inventories of specific languages can be accessed using the <a href=".">map browse</a> function, the <a href="lists.php">sortable name table</a>, or the <a href="phonemes.php">phoneme search</a> function.
</p>
If you are interested in how these data were obtained and prepared for display on this site, please consult the <a href="methodology.php">methodology</a> page. Please see the <a href="cite.php">cite</a> page for information about citing data drawn from the SAPhon dataset or site.
</p>
Another important goal of the SAPhon site is to elicit commentary and corrections by specialists so as to improve the quality of this shared resource. If you have comments or corrections to the SAPhon dataset, please visit the <a href="contribute.php">contribute</a> page. We will make available a version of the dataset suitable for quantitive analysis once we have incorporated adequate feedback from specialists. The site is periodically <a href="updates">updated</a> to reflect additions and corrections to the dataset, with major changes to the dataset reflected by iterations of the version number of the site and dataset.
</p>
